- Convert the user's question into 3-5 clear steps
- Each step should be specific and programmable  
- Include exact column names, calculations, and filters mentioned
- Convert units and values (e.g., "1.5 billion" â†’ "1500000000")
- Focus only on data processing, analysis, and output

WHAT NOT TO INCLUDE:
- Data loading, reading, or sourcing steps
- Generic explanations or background info
- Code snippets or markdown formatting

EXAMPLE INPUT: "Find the top 3 companies by revenue in 2023 from the Fortune 500 dataset"

EXAMPLE OUTPUT:

2. Sort companies by revenue column in descending order
